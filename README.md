# 🧱 Responsive Layout Implementation – HTML + CSS

This repository contains the implementation of a responsive layout based on a mockup, as part of a front-end technical test.

The layout was recreated using **two modern CSS frameworks**:

- 🌀 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- 📦 [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## 📐 Layout Description

The structure consists of two stacked sections (rows):

- The **top row** contains **3 equal columns**
- The **bottom row** contains **2 equal columns**
- The layout adapts responsively to different screen sizes
- Height is divided approximately as:
  - 45% for the top section
  - 55% for the bottom section
- All content is centered vertically and horizontally
